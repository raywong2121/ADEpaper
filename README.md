# Audit-Ready Evidence Packages for Post-Marketing Drug Safety

*(OMOP CDM · OHDSI/HADES · Multi-Drug · Multi-Window)*

## Overview

This repository contains **30 standardized evidence packages** generated by an **OHDSI-aligned, audit-ready post-marketing drug safety pipeline** operating on an OMOP CDM v6.0 electronic health record (EHR) database.

Each package corresponds to **one independent analysis run**, defined by a unique combination of:

* **Target drug** (OMOP standard drug concept ID), and
* **Design profile** (baseline, follow-up, and primary risk window).

In total, the repository includes:

* **5 drugs × 6 design profiles = 30 evidence packages**

The primary purpose of this repository is to demonstrate **how governance-aware, reproducible, and reviewable real-world evidence (RWE) outputs can be generated and packaged**, rather than to assert definitive causal safety conclusions.

## What is an “evidence package”?

Each evidence package is a **self-contained, zipped artifact** produced by a single pipeline run.
It is designed to be:

* **Audit-ready**: all key parameters are fully resolved and recorded;
* **Reproducible**: rerunning the same configuration on the same OMOP CDM instance yields the same structure and logic;
* **Reviewable**: outputs are separated into human-readable and machine-readable components.

A typical package contains:

```
/
├── analysis_manifest.txt        # Fully resolved run configuration (source of truth)
├── reports/
│   └── report.html              # Human-readable evidence report
├── outputs/
│   ├── hades_<drug_concept_id>/ # HADES outputs (scan summaries, estimation attempts)
│   ├── candidate_summaries.csv  # Screened outcomes with signal grading
│   ├── estimability_status.csv  # Method-level feasibility and failure reasons
│   └── logs/                    # Structured run logs
```

No patient-level data are included.
All outputs are **aggregate summaries**, subject to minimum cell-count suppression.

## Drugs and design profiles

### Drugs

The five target drugs are identified using **OMOP standard drug concept IDs** and include commonly used injectable medications (analgesics, corticosteroids, antibiotics, electrolyte preparations).
Exact mappings and exposure counts are documented in each package’s manifest.

### Design profiles

Each drug was evaluated under six **pre-specified design profiles**, representing different governance and safety-monitoring scenarios:

| Design profile       | Baseline (days) | Follow-up (days) | Primary risk window | Intended use                           |
| -------------------- | --------------- | ---------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `regulatory_365_365` | 365             | 365              | 365                 | Long-term, regulatory-style monitoring |
| `screening_365_90`   | 365             | 90               | 90                  | Screening with long baseline           |
| `screening_180_90`   | 180             | 90               | 90                  | Screening with moderate baseline       |
| `screening_90_30`    | 90              | 30               | 30                  | Short-term inpatient screening         |
| `screening_30_14`    | 30              | 14               | 14                  | Early safety signal detection          |
| `screening_30_7`     | 30              | 7                | 7                   | Rapid-cycle monitoring                 |

These profiles make **governance constraints explicit and comparable** across runs.

## What these packages are intended for

These evidence packages are suitable for:

* Demonstrating **end-to-end feasibility** of OMOP-based post-marketing surveillance
* Comparing **how safety signal yield and estimability change** across time windows
* Supporting **internal safety review**, method validation, or pipeline benchmarking
* Enabling **federated aggregation** across drugs, windows, or sites using a shared artifact contract
* Serving as **input artifacts** for downstream processes (e.g., label/SmPC or MAH signal crosswalks)

They are **not** intended to be used as stand-alone regulatory decisions without further confirmatory analysis and clinical adjudication.

## How to interpret the results

Several important characteristics should be noted when reviewing the packages:

1. **“No result” is a first-class outcome**
   Many outcomes are explicitly marked as *non-estimable* due to sparse data, lack of overlap, or model constraints. These are reported transparently rather than hidden.

2. **Short windows favor sensitivity, not causality**
   Increased-risk signals are primarily observed in 7- and 14-day windows and are often laboratory-based. These findings are **hypothesis-generating** and require confirmatory designs.

3. **Strict regulatory profiles may be infeasible at single sites**
   The `regulatory_365_365` profile produced report-level outputs but no HADES estimates in this dataset, highlighting data-depth limitations rather than pipeline failure.

4. **Comparator choice matters**
   Screening profiles use auto-inferred active comparators to improve feasibility. Comparator drift across profiles is documented and should be governed explicitly in production networks.

## Relationship to the accompanying manuscript

These evidence packages correspond to the analyses described in the associated manuscript:

> *A Governance-Aware, Audit-Ready OMOP–OHDSI Pipeline for Post-Marketing Drug Safety Surveillance: A Multi-Drug, Multi-Window Demonstration*

The repository is intended to function as a **transparent, inspectable companion** to the manuscript, allowing reviewers and collaborators to examine:

* exact run configurations,
* structured outputs,
* feasibility diagnostics, and
* limitations arising from data and governance constraints.

## Data and privacy

* All underlying EHR data remain local and are **not included** in this repository.
* Packages contain **aggregate results only**, with minimum cell-count suppression applied.
* The repository is suitable for public or controlled sharing without exposing patient-level information.

## License and reuse

The evidence packages are provided for **research, method evaluation, and demonstration purposes**.
Reuse should acknowledge the OMOP CDM and OHDSI ecosystem and respect local governance and privacy requirements when applying similar workflows to other datasets.
